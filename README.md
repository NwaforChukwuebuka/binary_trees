Project Overview: **
This project focused on exploring binary trees as data structures, including their details, advantages, and disadvantages. The project covered the qualification of trees and traversal methods, and involved the implementation of binary, binary search, AVL, and Max Binary Heap trees.

**Project Components: **
- **Tests: ** Folder containing test files provided by Holberton School.
- **Helper File:** `binary_tree_print.c` - C function for printing binary trees in a visually appealing format.
- **Header File:** `binary_trees.h` - Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions developed for the project.

**Data Structures:**
The project defined the following data structures and their corresponding function prototypes.

**Tasks:**
Certainly! Here are the tasks and their descriptions from the provided text:

---

**Tasks and Descriptions:**

1. **New node (0-binary_tree_node.c):**
   - C function that creates a binary tree node with a given parent and value.
   - Returns a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure.

2. **Insert left (1-binary_tree_insert_left.c):**
   - C function that inserts a node as the left-child of another.
   - Returns a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure.
   - If the given parent already contains a left node, the new node takes its place and the old left-child becomes the left-child of the new node.

3. **Insert right (2-binary_tree_insert_right.c):**
   - C function that inserts a node as the right-child of another.
   - Returns a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure.
   - If the given parent already contains a right node, the new node takes its place and the old right-child becomes the right-child of the new node.

4. **Delete (3-binary_tree_delete.c):**
   - C function that deletes an entire binary tree.

5. **Is leaf (4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c):**
   - C function that checks if a given node is a leaf.
   - Returns 1 if the node is a leaf, 0 otherwise.

6. **Is root (5-binary_tree_is_root.c):**
   - C function that checks if a given node is a root.
   - Returns 1 if the node is a root, 0 otherwise.

7. **Pre-order traversal (6-binary_tree_preorder.c):**
   - C function that traverses a tree using pre-order traversal.

8. **In-order traversal (7-binary_tree_inorder.c):**
   - C function that traverses a tree using in-order traversal.

9. **Post-order traversal (8-binary_tree_postorder.c):**
   - C function that traverses a tree using post-order traversal.

10. **Height (9-binary_tree_height.c):**
    - C function that returns the height of a binary tree.

11. **Depth (10-binary_tree_depth.c):**
    - C function that returns the depth of a given node in a binary tree.

12. **Size (11-binary_tree_size.c):**
    - C function that returns the size of a binary tree.

13. **Leaves (12-binary_tree_leaves.c):**
    - C function that returns the number of leaves in a binary tree.

14. **Nodes (13-binary_tree_nodes.c):**
    - C function that returns the number of nodes in a binary tree with at least one child.

15. **Balance factor (14-binary_tree_balance.c):**
    - C function that returns the balance factor of a binary tree.

16. **Is full (15-binary_tree_is_full.c):**
    - C function that checks if a binary tree is full.
    - Returns 1 if a tree is full, 0 otherwise.

17. **Is perfect (16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c):**
    - C function that checks if a binary tree is perfect.
    - Returns 1 if a tree is perfect, 0 otherwise.

18. **Sibling (17-binary_tree_sibling.c):**
    - C function that returns a pointer to the sibling of a given node in a binary tree.
    - Returns NULL if no sibling is found.

19. **Uncle (18-binary_tree_uncle.c):**
    - C function that returns a pointer to the uncle of a given node in a binary tree.
    - Returns NULL if no uncle is found.

20. **Lowest common ancestor (100-binary_trees_ancestor.c):**
    - C function that returns a pointer to the lowest common ancestor node of two given nodes in a binary tree.
    - Returns NULL if no common ancestor is found.

21. **Level-order traversal (101-binary_tree_levelorder.c):**
    - C function that traverses a binary tree using level-order traversal.

22. **Is complete (102-binary_tree_is_complete.c):**
    - C function that checks if a binary tree is complete.
    - Returns 1 if the tree is complete, 0 otherwise.

23. **Rotate left (103-binary_tree_rotate_left.c):**
    - C function that performs a left-rotation on a binary tree.
    - Returns a pointer to the new root node of the tree after rotation.

24. **Rotate right (104-binary_tree_rotate_right.c):**
    - C function that performs a right-rotation on a binary tree.

    - C function that checks if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree.
    - Returns 1 if the tree is a valid BST, 0 otherwise.
